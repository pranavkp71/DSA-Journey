## 2025-09-12 | LeetCode 1768: Merge Strings Alternately
- **Problem difficulty:** Easy 
- **Time taken:** ~1 hrs
- **What I learned:**
  - How to merge two strings alternately using a two pointer approach.
  - Handling leftover characters from the longer string separately.
  - Reading discussions can help understand different approaches when stuck.
- **Mistakes I made:**
  - Used `j < m` instead of `j < n` in the loop.
  - Got stuck in parts of the logic before realizing a simpler approach.
- **Reflection:**
  - Completing the problem not only gave me a correct solution but also reinforced my understanding of string manipulation and alternating patterns.
  - Felt rewarding to debug and finally understand the correct approach.


## 2025-09-12 | LeetCode 88: Merge Sorted Array
- **Problem difficulty:** Easy 
- **Time taken:** ~01:03:08 hrs
- **What I learned:**
  - How to use sort() to simplify merging after inserting elements.
  - Difference between an efficient two pointer approach and a simpler sorting based method.
  - Importance of clearly understanding the problem statement before jumping into coding.
- **Mistakes I made:**
  - Spent extra time trying the two pointer method without fully getting it right.
  - Initially confused about how m and n are used in the problem.
- **Reflection:**
  - This problem taught me how to analyze multiple approaches.
  - Even though I used sort(), I now understand the logic behind two pointer merging.
  - Felt good to finally clear my confusion and complete the problem.

## 2025-09-13 | LeetCode 283: Move Zeroes
- **Problem difficulty:** Easy 
- **Time taken:** ~01:20:37 hrs
- **What I learned:**
  - How to use the two pointer technique.  i to scan, j to place non zeros.
  - The importance of a second pass to fill the remaining array positions with zeros.
- **Mistakes I made:**
  - Initially tried using sort(), which was wrong for this problem.
  - Forgot to handle leftover values after moving non zeros.
- **Reflection:**
  - This problem taught me how to analyze multiple approaches.
  - Submitting and passing all test cases felt great since I built the correct solution step by step.
